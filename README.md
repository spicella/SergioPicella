## Welcome to my personal website!



## Me, in a nutshell

I'm Sergio Picella, an Italian MSc student in Experimental Physics at **Utrecht University** (NL) currently working on my thesis in the *[Soft Robotic Matter](http://www.overvelde.com/)* group at [AMOLF](https://amolf.nl/). Before going to Netherlands I graduated at the **Universit√† degli Studi "Aldo Moro"** in Bari (IT) and followed the courses in the first year of the Condesed Matter MSc before deciding to have an experience abroad in a different context.

I am mainly interested in Complex Systems, Condesed Matter and Modelling, but I am mostly attracted by whatever contamination in sciences though!
