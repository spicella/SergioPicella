## Me, in a nutshell

I'm Sergio Picella, an Italian MSc student in Experimental Physics at **Utrecht University** (NL), currently working on my thesis in the *[Soft Robotic Matter](http://www.overvelde.com/)* group at [AMOLF](https://amolf.nl/). Before coming to the Netherlands, I graduated from the **Università degli Studi "Aldo Moro"** in Bari (IT) and followed the courses in the first year of the Condensed Matter MSc before deciding to have an experience abroad in a different context.

I am mainly interested in Complex Systems, Condensed Matter and Modelling. Still, I am primarily attracted by whatever contamination in sciences, though!
When I have free time, I generally enjoy a good run or play some tune!
